# JailbreakPaycheckData

Some paycheck data from everyone who abused the `time 5` command for infinite money

You can find how many paychecks you got from this glitch by using ctrl + f on [the main file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarmonicDust/JailbreakPaycheckData/refs/heads/main/index.lua) and find your Roblox UserId

If you can't find it, your user id is on your profile: https://www.roblox.com/users/2516134171/profile
In this case my Roblox UserId is 2516134171

## Format:
```lua
local table1 = {
    ["2516134171"] = 999 -- UserId, # of times you've used "time 5" command
}
